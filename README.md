# Github Finder - Simple Single-Page React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background

This is a simple React application that communicates with Github's REST API and allows user searching and retrieving Github profiles and display data in a nice and user-friendly way

It uses utility-first CSS framework `TailwindCSS` as well as `DaisyUI`, which is built on top of TailwindCSS and provides nice pre-built components to make development easier.

This application is also a learning project that goes over many fundamentals of ReactJS library. These include:
- Browser Router and defining routes
- Reducers to update states effectively
- Spinner components when loading data from API
- Custom 404 (Not Found) Page
- Various React hooks: useEffect, useReducer, useContext, useParams etc.
- Context API to avoid prop drilling
- Other commonly used code in Javascript and React - asynchronous functions, controlled inputs, alerts, user input validation etc.

## To Run This Application

Clone this repository, and in the project directory run `npm start`. Then you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
